Good morning. I'm interested in applying for the Master's program in Data Science at your university. I'd like some information regarding the admission process. Good morning. I'd be happy to help. The admission process involves submitting an online application followed by an entrance exam and an interview. Okay. And what are the eligibility criteria? The applicants must have a bachelor's degree in computer science, mathematics or a related field with at least 60% marks. Additionally, prior knowledge of programming languages like Python C is required and recommended. That sounds great. Could you also tell me about the scholarship opportunities? Yes, sure. We offer merit based scholarships for students with exceptional academic performance. If you score above 85% in your entrance test, you will be eligible for a 50% tuition fee waiver.
