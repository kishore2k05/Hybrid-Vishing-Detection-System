Hello? Yes, this is Samantha from the marketing team. I'm having trouble with my office printer. It's not responding to any print commands. Good morning, Samantha, this is Rhea from IT Support. I'd be happy to assist you. Could you tell me the model of the printer? Yes, it's an HP LaserJet Pro10404DN. It was working fine yesterday, but today it's just not printing anything. Got it. Have you tried restarting the printer and checking if it's connected to the network? I restarted it once, but I didn't check the network connection. Let me do that now. Okay, I see the printer is not showing up the network. That could be the issue. Please try reconnecting it to the WI fi or using an ethernet cable. If that doesn't work, I can send a technician to check. Alright, I'll try reconnecting it. If it still doesn't work, I'll get back to you. Thanks for the help. No problem, Samantha. Let me know if you need further assistance. Thank you.
