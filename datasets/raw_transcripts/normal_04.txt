Hi, this is Rani from the finance department. I'd like to request a new laptop for work. Good morning. Rani, this is Meera from the administration team. Could you provide some details regarding your request? Sure. My current laptop is quite outdated and I'm facing performance issues while working on large financial reports. I'd like to request an upgrade. Understood. We have a standard update policy. Could you confirm your current device model? Yes, it's a Dell latitude 5480. Thank you. Based on company policy you are eligible for an upgrade to a Dell latitude 7420. I'll need to get an approval from your department head before proceeding. That sounds great. How long will this process take? Once approved we can issue the new laptop within five to seven business days. I'll send you a request form to fill out. Perfect. I completed by today. Thanks for your help. You're welcome Rani. Let me know if you need any assistance with the process. Sure.
