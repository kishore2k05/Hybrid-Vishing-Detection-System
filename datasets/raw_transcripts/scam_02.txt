Hello? Yes, this. This is Anjali from Bank of Baroda's fraud prevention department. Am I speaking with Daniel? Yes, who is this again? I'm calling because we detected an unusual login attempt on your account from a different location. To protect your funds, we need to verify if this was you. It is a quick security check. Can you confirm the last four digits of your debit card? Yes, it's 4832. Thanks. Now, as part of a fraud protection process, we've just sent you a security code via sms. Have you received it? Yes, I do see a message with a six digit number. Great. For verification, please read that code to me. This will confirm that you are the rightful account holder and we can block any fraudulent activity. Okay. The code is 876542. Perfect. Your account is now secure. If you get any more alerts, don't worry. It's just part of our system updating. If you need further assistance, call our official helpline. Have a great day. Thank you. Thank you.
