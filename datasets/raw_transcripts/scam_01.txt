Hello? Hello? Hi, this is Rhea calling from Amazon's billing department. Am I speaking with Veda? Yes, who's this? I'm reaching out because we found an accidental overcharge on your last payment to Amazon. So we're issuing a refund of five thousand rupees to your account. I just need to verify your details to process it. A refund? I don't remember any extra charges. Yes, I completely understand. This was a billing system error and we are refunding all affected customers. The amount will be credited within 5, 5 to 10 minutes after verification. Could you confirm your bank account so we can reprocess the refund? Okay. I use bank of Barida. Perfect. Now our system has just sent a confirmation code to your registered number. This is part of our security process to ensure the refund goes to the right. Please read out the code so we can complete the transaction. I just got a message. It says OTP for transaction. Wait, why does it say transaction? Oh, that's just how our system logs it. It's still a refund process. No money is deducted from your account. We just need it to authorize the reversal. Please provide the code so we can finalize your refund. Okay, the code is 654321. Thank you. The refund has been successfully processed. You should receive an SMS confirmation shortly. If you have any concerns, feel free to call our official helpline at the number in our website. Have a great day. Thank you.
