Hi. Hi. My name is Priya Sharma. I have a savings account with your bank and I recently made a transaction, but it's not reflecting in my statement. Good afternoon, Mrs. Sharma. I'd be happy to assist. Could you provide me with your account number and the transaction details? Sure. My account number is 123-45-6789. And I transferred 5,000 to an account at another bank yesterday at around 3pm thank you. Let me check the transaction history for your account. I see that the transaction is still pending. It usually takes up to 24 hours for interbank transfers to reflect. I understand, but it has been over 24 hours now. Is there any way to escalate this? Yes. I can raise a request to our transaction team to investigate. I will also provide you with a reference number for tracking your request. That would be great. Please proceed. Done. Your reference number is TXN 987654. You should receive an update within 48 hours. Thank you so much for your help. You're welcome. Have a great day.
